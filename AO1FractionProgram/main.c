/*

  A01 Fraction Program

  Program Structure:

    - This file:
      Runs fnctions from various header files.
    
    - IO.h
      Header file containing IO functions, 
      Interface between User and Program 

    - Operations.h
      Header file containing all functions created for specific operations,
      Including Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and so on...
      All those functions are abstracted away.
      The only visible function visible is getFunctionToRun()
      decideWhatToDo will return a function pointer that can be ran.

    - DataBase.h
      Contains MultiDimensional Arrays that can be used to store data.
      Syntax Sugar: Just include this header file to access these arrays instead
      of passing them by reference each time.

    WHAT IS THIS CODE??
    IS THIS EVEN C?
    REALLY? 

    Yes this is C, we just copied
    the style used in Dynamically Typed 
    Languages like Lua, Java Script, etc.

    DataBase_ProgramCanRun() is from DataBase.h, which we call A for now.
    getResponse() is from IO.h, which we call B for now.
    getFunctionToRun() is from Operations.h, which we call C for now.

    A returns true if the program can still run,
    because a function interally called makes A return false
    so that when A is called next time this loop can stop.
    
    B gets response from the user, basically user input that
    tells the user what program should do next.

    C takes the user response, and returns the address
    to the function that can execute the task.

    We take that function and directly run it.

    This process is repeated until A returns false.
